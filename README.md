TASK 2 : Customer segmentation

This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Using K-means clustering, customers are grouped into clusters according to their purchase frequency and total amount spent. The dataset used for this analysis includes synthetic customer purchase history data, containing information such as how often customers make purchases and the total amount they spend. The K-means algorithm is applied to this data to identify distinct customer segments, allowing the retail store to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to different customer groups effectively. The project includes code for generating the synthetic dataset, performing K-means clustering, and visualizing the resulting clusters.

KMeans Clustering for Mall Customers

This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on the "mall_customers.csv" dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score.

Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and understand customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering. The dataset used contains information about customers' annual income and spending scores on a scale of 1 to 100.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "mall_customers.csv." It contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer
Spending Score (1-100): Score based on customer behavior and purchasing data


Approach

The main steps in this project include:

Data Preprocessing:

Exploring the dataset,encoding categorical variables.
KMeans Clustering: Using the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.
Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to understand the distinct customer segments.
Files
mall_customers.csv: The dataset used for clustering.
KMeans_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for KMeans clustering.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Usage
To run the code:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Open and run the KMeans_Clustering.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
Results
The output of this project will include visualizations showing the clusters formed based on annual income and spending score. It will help in identifying distinct customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing strategies.
